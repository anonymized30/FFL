# Enhanced Security and Privacy via Fragmented Federated Learning
This repository contains PyTorch implementation of the paper: Enhanced Security and Privacy via Fragmented Federated Learning

## Paper 

[Enhanced Security and Privacy via Fragmented Federated Learning]

## Content
The repository contains one main jupyter notebook: `Experiments.IPYNB` in each folder which can be used to re-produce the experiments reported in the paper. Each notebook contains clear instructions on how to run the experiments. 



**DISCLAIMER:** provided source code does **NOT** include the code of reconstruction attacks.
Usage and distribution of such code should be done separately at their authors' disclosure.
Reach out ([Inverting Gradients](https://github.com/JonasGeiping/invertinggradients)). We just provide a jupyter notebook that requires other packages from the mentioned source.

To simplify reproduction, we provide the experiments on [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) datasets.
[IMDB](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) requires manual downloads that are still not ready and that will be included soon.
## Dependencies

[Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

[PyTorch 1.6](https://pytorch.org/)

[TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
